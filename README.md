# gb-emu
Nintendo Gameboy Emulator written in C++

Currently passes all of Blargg's test roms except for the timer test.
Video is almost entirely working with some minor sprite glitches.
Audio is partially implemented with substantial glitches.

Build with cmake. Requires the SDL2 framework to be installed.
